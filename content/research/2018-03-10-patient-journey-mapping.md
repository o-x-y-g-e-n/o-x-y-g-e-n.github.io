For successful innovations it is important to fully understand the context, stakeholders and opportunities. The goal of the course is to make sense of this complexity, and apply a design tool that is used at Delft University: the Patient Journey method.

**Role and Duration**

Patient Journey Mapping, Understanding the problem context, Identifying key actors

_September 2019 - November 2019_

## The challenge

![](pjourney_challenge.png)

**MAIN TAKEAWAYS**

- SEIN wants you to think of a product or device that can help a child with epilepsy, as well as their parents, have a safe night sleep.

- Epilepsy is a disease of the brain, it causes seizures which are events of over excitation of brain cells. What this does to the body depends on the location of this excitation. It can range from small jerky movements from a body part to someone losing consciousness. Seizures are often unpredictable. Most seizures will stop spontaneously, others need medication to stop them. SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy) is where people die after a seizure but we are unable to identify the exact cause.

- Seizure detection devices can help monitor the patients by alarming parents and caregivers when the patients suffers from a seizure. Auditory systems listen to the people and pick up sounds related to epilepsy. Video cameras can monitor the people. Sensors placed in a bed mattress can pick up the movement when someone is shaking. Bracelets can pick up movements as well as heart rate.

- For patients at home, a lot of seizure detection devices are not yet reimbursed by healthcare insurance. Also, not all parents or caregivers trust a seizure detection device.

- The seizure devices are often too sensitive, leading to many false alarms. From a doctor's perspective, we especially want the large and potentially dangerous seizures to be alarmed by the device. From a parent or caregiver's perspective, they want to know of all seizures, also the little ones.

- When the patient lives at the facility, nurses and doctors who watch over them. At home, the whole family gets involved.

The start of making a patient journey is taking the person and his or her context into account. We call the other people and processes surrounding the patient **actors**, because they actively contribute to the health of the patient.

> Step one of creating a patient journey is to map the actors and their interdependencies.

> Time is a relevant factor in the process of healing, also in the use of products and the interaction of services. All of the above can be divided into several phases over time. The interdependencies between actors can differ from phase to phase; not all actors are involved in every phase. Therefore, it is important to take time into consideration when mapping the system to clearly identify interactions.

### The Research Problem

> How is a year of a family and a child with epilepsy when the episodes are scarce (3-4 times a year)

![](pjourney_assignment_2-3.jpg)

> To understand your user group better, you need to try and understand how a product or service is experienced from a person's point of view. You can include the emotions with smileys, plus and minus signs, or a graph. You can nuance the emotions by adding in words such as chaos and despair and adding a quote from the interviews

### Finding Emotions

**MAIN TAKEAWAYS**

> People can feel insecure or uncertain because seizures are unpredictable.

> After a good night sleep without hearing an alarm a parent may feel relieved and happy that nothing happened that night. Or, they might feel suspicious and wonder whether they missed anything.

> When there is a seizure and the alarm goes off, parents can feel afraid, anxious, alerted, helpless or relieved. Parents/caregivers feel frustrated when the monitoring device does not work well. They feel relieved when they can help the child.

> Some children do not notice their seizures. Others may be afraid of having a seizure while going to sleep. When a child has had a seizure, they need the parent/caregiver to comfort them to go back to sleep.

> How do your insights become the starting point of your ideas?

### Finding the touchpoints

> To identify friction points that can lead to new opportunities, we need to find where the patient's needs are not being met. The voice of the patient can be represented with quotes from our interviews.

> We design for complex systems by defining the root of the problem and its consequences. We take on board all the actors that are connected to the problem. Defining the right scope of the problem is key to finding the root and implementing the right solution.

### What's next?

We have identified the challenge. The goal is the deep dive into the challenge
with some rapid prototyping and testing with users.
