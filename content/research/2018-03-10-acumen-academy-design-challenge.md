## The Challenge
![Acumen Challenge](assets/acumen_challenge.png)


### The Design Process
The human-centered design process has three phases—**the Inspiration phase**, **the Ideation phase**, and **the Implementation phase**. we`ve kept the people we’re looking to serve at the heart of the process.


### INSPIRATION

**I have a design challenge.**
> How do I get started? 
How do I conduct an interview?
How do I stay human-centered?

### Planning the Research

Writing down the potential people to speak with and places to visit as part of the research. The group of interviewees were divided into four segments,

**A. People to Learn from**
Who will you be designing for? We considered both the core user and the extended community. We imagined a map of all the people who might have something to do with the design challenge, characteristics that would make them interesting to meet. We Also considered speaking with users who represent extreme (as opposed to mainstream) viewpoints.

**B. Experts to Speak to**
Who are the inspiring researchers or organizations in the space of the design challenge? Successful members of the target population can also be great
experts.

**C. In-Context Immersion Locations**
With a curious mindset, inspiration and new perspectives can be found in many places and without much preparation.We planned our observations by choosing places where we can have experiences that are relevant to our challenge.

**D. Analogous Inspiration Locations**
What are the activities, emotions, and behaviors that make up the experience of the challenge? Now select similar scenarios that you would like to observe in places and situations that are different than the design challenge.

### Building an Interview Guide
**Objectives**:
* The Motivation to start his/her own company
* Undertstanding how he/she brought an idea to life
* The challenges faced during the process of moving from an idea to startup
    * Mentorship & Network
    * Captial
    * Startup Community Support
* Understanding how he measures impact.

We brainstormed a lot of questions, some relevant to the challenges, some personal, and some to make them feel comfortable. Finally, we prepared a `mindmap` of questions and who / when is gonna lead the story. Some of the important questions were, 
> How did you start your journey as an entrepreneur? From the beginning till now?

> Can you tell me about your expectations? ​ What did you expect to find and **what made you frustrated**?

> How do you connect with people? How do you share your ideas?

> What do you think about the Social Innovation & Entrepreneurship programs that already exist? How do you think an ideal support system should be?

> What are things that keep socialentrepreneurs from succeeding in fulfilling their potential?

> How can we improve today’s existing mentorship programs?

### Conducting the Research
We divided the team into 2 groups, one the *India Group* and other the *Turkey Group*, so that it would be easy for us, to conduct interviews, and while one of the member is asking the questions, others can **shadow** (observe and take notes). After rigorous interviews, we converted each learning into a **story**.

**Key Learnings from Research**
![](assets/acumen_random_thoughts.png)
Below are highlights from all the groups & all different locations (remotely) where we conducted interviews. 

> People lack inner motivation and avoid working hard and care less about society

> Personal ethical values sometimes drag down the growth of an individual especially in social sector

> Sustainability is very important for Social Entrepreneurs

> Organizations (private & Government) that provide support to Social Entrepreneurs don't always work.

> Students / Young people don't always feel motivated & qualified to take social initiatives.

> Social Entrepreneurship should be made attractive. (especially for younger generation)

> Schools & Colleges lack the proper education standard to motivate younger generation

> Networking is extremely crucial for Entrepreneurs


We also distributed ***surveys*** among various active groups over social media. We were able to get very useful insights from that as well. We brainstormed top questions for the survey, with accurate and temptive options.

### IDEATION
**I have an opportunity for design.**
> How do I interpret what I’ve learned?
How do I turn my insights into 
tangible ideas? 
How do I make a prototype?

### Cluster Into Themes
The goal for this exercise was to make sense out of the stories we heard and begin looking for themes to design around. The goal was to identify ***gems***, cluster information into themes, finding supportive evidences, refining clusters and writing headlines on the storyboard. We used *Miro* to gather & brainstorm all the information gathered.
![](acumen_ideation_dashboard.jpg)

The key headlines were:
* Ethical Values
* Mentorship
* Obstacles
* Social Entrepreneurship Programs
* Networking
* Financial 
* Awareness
* Motivation
* Young

We narrowed down from the above headlines to three major challenging topics, and formed ***How might we?*** questions for the headlines. The selected headlines were:
* Financial, *constraints & challenges*
* Awareness, *about different programs among different sectors*
* Mentorship, *for young people by experienced and leaders in the sector*
![](assets/acumen_ideation_hmw_questions.jpg)

The following were the selected *How might we?*  questions,
> HMW take care of financials when people begin their social entrepreneurship journey?

> HMW create awareness about social entrepreneurships that they are real business that needs money?

> HMW encourage social entrepreneurs to come up with financial business models in the beginning?

> HMW increase awareness in school about social entrepreneurship at a young age?

> HMW help industry giants / universities to start/adopt a social entrepreneurship cell in their company?

> HMW make social entrepreneurship attractive as a career?

> HMW help people to create opportunities in the small cities?

> HMW ensure to meet proper and qualified mentor for entrepreneurs?

> HMW create meaningfull reverse mentorship structure?

> HMW make government & social entrepreneurship collaboration seamless?

The next goal was to create **storyboards**. A storyboard is a visualization of
the end-to-end experience a user might have with your idea over time. We also identified important **actors** for the research.

### Implementation

**I have an innovative solution.**
> How do I make my concept real?
How do I assess if it’s working?
How do I plan for sustainability?

Then we created (rough) wireframes for an mobile application.

### What's next?
We still have a long way to go. From creating high fidelity prototypes to pitching our idea, the process will continue.
